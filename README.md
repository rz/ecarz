A basic elementary cellular automaton simulator. Capable of simulating
all the 2-color automata in 1D and 2D with Moore neighborhood.

Rules are numbered according to the Wolfram numbering convention.
See: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html

Note that there are 2^512 possible rules in 2D, but very few of them are
interesting. In this numbering scheme Conway's Game of Life is rule number
